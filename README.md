**Requirements**





**Requirement R1**

**Description of your website, including:**

**\- Purpose**

The purpose of the **Personal Job Application Management** website is to manage applying for Jobs with self-reliance. The benefit is the clarity confidence that comes from being organised. 

In today’s highly competitive job market, a candidate applies for 50 to 100 roles to find the best suited job. The roles and requirements of each of these jobs are different. 

Apart from the cover letter, each resume used for applying for a job may be different. Why is the resume and cover letter different?

1. Making the filtering of resume easier for the recruitment manager. 
2. Highlighting and providing details of the experience and skills required for the specific role in the resume.
3. Covering the specific details requested in cover letter by the recruitment manager.

What else is important for the candidate?

1. A copy of the job advertisement. The companies remove the job ads once they start the recruitment process.
2. The different roles applied in a company. It is likely the candidate has applied for multiple roles advertised by an employer on different sites. There should be no contradictions between the resumes used for different roles within the same employer. 
3. The candidate has to remember the details of the application even if the employer takes a while to respond to applications.
4. The employer or the company’s profile to know the employer.
5. The up-to-date news about the company.

All the points listed above are highly likely to help the job applicant to manage the job search phase with self-reliance.
